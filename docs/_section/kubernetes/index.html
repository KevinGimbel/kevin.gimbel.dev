<p>Since starting at AOE I deepend my knowledge of Kubernetes, working with multiple clusters, developing tools, and working with Developer Teams everyday. I've also started co-teaching the <a href="https://www.aoe.com/en/academy/cloud-devops/kubernetes-101.html">&quot;Kubernetes 101&quot;</a> Workshop where a co-host and me give a introduction to Kubernetes concepts.</p>

Setting up infrastructure in the cloud can be a lot of work and the more manual steps are involved, the more likely errors will be introduced.

Over the past two years I've gained a lot of experience building, managing, and upgrading infrastructure with terraform and Ansible. I've also build internal tooling to help Developers interact with the infrastructure we build.

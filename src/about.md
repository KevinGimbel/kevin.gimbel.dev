I‚Äôm a self-taught **DevOps Engineer** with a background in _Front-End Development_, my first contact with HTML and CSS was around 2007 when I wanted to style my MySpace profile, later I made a websites for my Habbo Hotel trading business (yes, we had dragon statues in all colors!)

Following those first steps I started to get into photography and wanted to specialize in web development to showcase my photographs, at the time I still wanted to work as a concert photographer or designer professionally and didn‚Äôt really think about becoming a programmer. When I did an year-long internship with a Design agency and my boss asked if I could build a website for a client I said ‚ÄúYes of course!‚Äù, bought ‚ÄúPHP for Dummies‚Äù and coded the website while learning PHP (yes, I was very confident at the time). Like a miracle, it worked and the client was happy.

In 2014, after specializing more in HTML and CSS I, started as a Front-End Developer at Synoa GmbH and then shifted into DevOps in 2018. 

In 2023 I started working as a DevOps Engineer at [AOE GmbH](https://aoe.com/).
